## Introduction

The Face Mask Detection project aims to build a robust machine learning model to identify whether people in images or videos are wearing face masks. This is especially relevant in contexts like public health monitoring during pandemics.

## Features

- Detects face masks with high accuracy.
- Supports image and video inputs.
- Easily modifiable and extendable codebase.
- Detailed evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

## Dataset 

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images indicating whether individuals are wearing face masks. You can either use a publicly available dataset or prepare your own dataset. Ensure the dataset is organized into appropriate directories for training and validation.


Happy Coding!!
